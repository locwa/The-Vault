As the third and final evolution of the model, the SV is especially coveted, with only 10 production cars originally made for the United States market, making it exceedingly rare among collectors.\r\n\r\nDesigned by Marcello Gandini for Bertone, the Miura\'s groundbreaking aesthetic introduced a mid-mounted V12 engine layout directly behind the cockpit, a bold configuration that became standard for high-performance sports cars. Its debut at the 1965 Turin Auto Show captured the world’s attention, establishing Lamborghini’s reputation and challenging marques like Ferrari and Porsche.\r\n\r\nThe Miura SV\'s 4.0-liter V12 engine saw enhancements in camshaft timing and 4 X 3-barrel Weber carburetors, pushing power to 385 BHP and allowing a top speed of 179 MPH. The final 96 SV models were notable for their split-sump lubrication system, which separated the engine and gearbox oiling systems. This change enabled the use of specialized oils for each component and supported the ZF limited-slip differential.\r\n\r\nVisually, the SV distinguished itself from the earlier P400 and P400 S with its absence of the characteristic “eyelashes” around the headlamps, a lowered stance, and wider rear fenders to fit nine-inch wide wheels paired with larger Pirelli tires. Tail lights were also uniquely styled for the SV.\r\n\r\nThe interior of the SV offered greater luxury, with leather upholstery as standard, replacing the vinyl found in the P400 and P400 S, ensuring a more refined driving experience. These enhancements, combined with its rarity, underline the SV’s status as a high point in Lamborghini’s storied history.',1,'2025-02-15 02:41:09',NULL,'2025-02-23 15:48:55',1,15),(27,'Mercedes-Benz','CLK-GTR Roadster','2002','27-Mercedes-Benz-2002-CLK-GTR-Roadster-',15000000,22,'The 2002 Mercedes-Benz CLK-GTR Roadster is one of the rarest and most exclusive cars in automotive history, and with just 22 kilometers on the odometer, this example is essentially untouched. Owned in a private Saudi collection, this car is one of only six roadsters ever produced, making it a remarkable piece of engineering and a direct descendant of one of the most iconic race cars of the late 1990s.\r\n\r\nThe CLK-GTR was born from Mercedes-Benz’s pursuit of dominance in the FIA GT Championship. To meet homologation rules, Mercedes was required to produce a small number of road-going versions of their GT1 race car, the same car they campaigned on the track. The FIA GT Championship required manufacturers to build at least 25 street-legal versions of their GT1 entries, ensuring that the race cars were based on production models, rather than pure prototypes.\r\n\r\nMercedes-Benz complied by producing 20 coupes and 6 roadsters, with the first street version being completed in late 1998. The roadster variant, introduced later, was even more exclusive, with its open-top design making it a unique variant of the already scarce CLK-GTR. Both the coupe and roadster versions were nearly identical to the race cars in terms of engineering, with minor changes made for road use, such as slightly higher ride height and added comfort features.\r\n\r\nUnder the hood, the CLK-GTR Roadster was powered by a 6.9-liter V12, derived from the racing version, producing 612 horsepower. This allowed the car to accelerate from 0 to 60 mph in just over 3 seconds, with a top speed of around 208 mph. The CLK-GTR was one of the most powerful and fastest cars of its time, offering a racing experience on the road that very few cars could match.\r\n\r\nThe Mercedes-Benz CLK-GTR was initially designed for the 1997 FIA GT Championship, where it quickly established itself as a dominant force. With its 6.0-liter V12 engine and advanced aerodynamics, the race-spec CLK-GTR won the championship in its debut year, securing Mercedes\' reputation in the GT1 category. The car was developed in just 128 days, a testament to the engineering prowess of Mercedes-AMG. The CLK-GTR continued its success in 1998, securing another FIA GT Championship title, though it later faced stiffer competition from Porsche and Toyota.\r\n\r\nAfter the FIA GT Championship canceled its GT1 category following the 1998 season, Mercedes-Benz turned its focus to the 24 Hours of Le Mans, developing the Mercedes-Benz CLR. The CLR was a refined evolution of the CLK-GTR, designed specifically for endurance racing. However, the CLR’s Le Mans campaign in 1999 is remembered for a major issue with aerodynamic instability. The car infamously took flight at high speeds during practice and the race itself, resulting in dramatic crashes. These accidents led Mercedes-Benz to withdraw from top-level endurance racing for years afterward.\r\n\r\nThis particular CLK-GTR Roadster, with only 22 kilometers, is a pristine example of the road-going version of Mercedes’ GT1 racing heritage. The open-top design of the roadster variant is especially rare, adding a layer of exclusivity to what was already a limited-production, high-performance supercar.\r\n\r\nWith its origins deeply rooted in racing history, the CLK-GTR Roadster stands as one of the most significant homologation cars ever produced. The combination of its extreme rarity, direct lineage to a championship-winning race car, and untouched condition makes it a coveted collector\'s item. Seeing one of these in such pristine condition is like stepping back in time to the golden age of GT1 racing.',0,'2025-02-15 16:19:41',NULL,'2025-02-23 15:44:13',1,18),(28,'Lamborghini','Diablo GTR','2001','28-Lamborghini-2001-Diablo-GTR-',3000000,4571,'The 2001 Lamborghini Diablo GTR stands as one of the most audacious, track-focused Lamborghinis ever produced, and this particular example, chassis #ZA9EAGTR0YLA12560, has a history as bold as its design. Originally finished in Giallo Evros and later resprayed in Blu Metallic, this car carries a rich racing pedigree, including a dramatic performance in the 2001 Lamborghini Supertrophy series.\r\n\r\nSupplied new to Lease Plan, France on February 21, 2001, and leased by MMC Cars Michel Mhitarian and Keuelian Motors, this Diablo GTR quickly found itself on the racetrack. At the 2001 Monza Supertrophy Round 2, race #6, driven by Englishman Lee Cunningham, became a standout by climbing from 18th on the grid to finish 6th overall—an incredible feat that earned him the Top Gentleman Driver Trophy. The GTR\'s presence in the series was notable, competing alongside the likes of Michele Alboreto, a former Formula 1 driver, and Luc Alphand, a French ski pro, both of whom piloted the series’ VIP car.\r\n\r\nIn 2000, Lamborghini introduced the Diablo GTR as a replacement for the SV-R, designed specifically for single-make Super Trofeo racing. While based on the already extreme Diablo GT, the GTR took things further, with significant modifications aimed at making it a purebred race car. With only 30 examples built, it remains one of the rarest and most sought-after factory-built race cars from Lamborghini.\r\n\r\nThe GTR was engineered to be lighter and more aerodynamic, with its body made almost entirely of carbon fiber—save for the roof and doors, which remained metal for safety and rigidity. Weight-saving measures included stripping out the interior, leaving only a racing seat, minimal instrumentation, and a full roll cage for protection. Plexiglass windows replaced traditional glass to further reduce weight and allow some air circulation into the cockpit, and a massive rear wing was bolted directly to the chassis to improve stability at high speeds.\r\n\r\nThe Lamborghini Diablo GTR represented the brand\'s most extreme foray into motorsport at the time, with revised aerodynamics, a stripped-down interior, and the big-bore V12 delivering relentless power.',0,'2025-02-15 16:28:08',NULL,'2025-02-23 15:35:15',1,16),(29,'Ferrari','288 GTO','1985','29-Ferrari-1985-288-GTO-',6000000,1607,'The Ferrari 288 GTO, chassis number 7725, finished in iconic Rosso Corsa with a black and red interior, is a cornerstone of Ferrari\'s supercar legacy. With just 1600 KM (~990 miles), this example epitomizes the blend of racing heritage and road-going performance that defines Ferrari\'s flagship models and maintains extreme originality.\r\n\r\nProduced from 1984 to 1987 in Ferrari\'s Maranello factory, the 288 GTO (Type F114) was a limited edition evolution of the popular 308 GTB. The GTO designation, standing for Gran Turismo Omologata, pays homage to the legendary 250 GTO, Ferrari\'s flagship from 1962 to 1964. Though originally built to compete in the Group B racing series, the 288 GTO never raced due to the series\' cancellation. However, its design and engineering set the stage for the modern supercar, embodying the \"racing car for the street\" concept.\r\n\r\nUnder its hood, the 288 GTO features the first turbocharged engine in a production Ferrari. This 2.8-liter DOHC V8 is equipped with IHI twin-turbochargers, Behr air-to-air intercoolers, and Weber-Marelli fuel injection, reflecting Ferrari\'s Formula One turbo technology of the era. The result is a formidable powerplant that delivers both performance and innovation.\r\n\r\nThe interior of the 288 GTO strikes a balance between minimalist design and luxury, featuring comfortable leather seats and air conditioning, along with intuitively placed buttons and switches. This car not only delivers on the track but also provides a refined driving experience on the road.\r\n\r\nAs the first of Ferrari’s decennially produced, limited edition supercars, the 288 GTO established a lineage continued by the F40, F50, Enzo, and LaFerrari. Each of these models incorporated Ferrari’s latest racing-derived technology, further cementing the 288 GTO\'s role as a pivotal model in Ferrari\'s storied history.',0,'2025-02-15 16:36:19',NULL,'2025-02-23 15:20:17',1,18),(30,'Lamborghini','Diablo SVR','1996','30-Lamborghini-1996-Diablo-SVR-',2000000,16000,'Chassis Number TLA12573 is a European market car finished in striking Arancio, and it\'s number 11 of the 32 Lamborghini Diablo SVRs ever produced.

This model made its debut in a support race at the 1996 24 Hours of Le Mans, marking Lamborghini\'s first venture into factory-built race cars.\r\n\r\nDesigned for pure performance, the SVR was stripped of the standard Diablo\'s luxury features to save weight. It featured race bucket seats with harnesses, a full roll cage, a larger rear wing, and revised bumpers to enhance aerodynamics and downforce.\r\n\r\nUnder the hood, the SVR\'s 5.7L V12 engine was tuned to produce 540 HP. Enhancements included a race-specific exhaust, adjustments to the fuel injection system and ignition timing for better responsiveness, and high-performance components like forged pistons and lightweight connecting rods. The engine also benefited from improved cooling systems, with upgraded radiators and additional cooling ducts to maintain optimal temperatures under racing conditions.\r\n\r\nThroughout the Lamborghini Supertrophy series, the Diablo SVR demonstrated its racing prowess, cementing Lamborghini\'s place in motorsport.

Second in the line of Ferrari Supercars, supplanting the 288 GTO, and built to compete in the market place against Porsche’s brilliant 959 as both companies were eager to demonstrate the technology they were gaining in racing at the time into their production lines.\r\n\r\nUnlike, the 959 which Porsche raced only sparingly as the 961, Ferrari had success racing the F40 for several years (as the F40/LM) in sports car racing, mainly in Stephane Ratel’s BPR Global GT Series (rebranded FIA GT) and in the IMSA GTO category entered by Ferrari of France with top drivers such as Jean Alesi, Jacques Laffite, Michele Ferte and Hurley Haywood in selected events In Michelotto LM spec, the twin-turbocharged Ferrari V8 Type F 120 B was uprated to more than 785BHP using enlarged turbochargers, bigger intercoolers, and a better Weber-Marelli fuel injection system. Utilizing technology learned from the Group B 288 GTO Evoluzione development, it also had a stiffer chassis, an upgraded transmission, better brakes and altered exterior aero equipment. Rated at about 2,350 pounds, it was one of the fastest cars on the planet at the time.\r\n\r\nStill seen by many as the ultimate Ferrari, the F40 has enjoyed a long ride atop the motoring\r\nworld’s many lists of all-time favorite cars and the F40/LM is the ultimate development of the\r\noriginal road-going version.\r\n\r\nOriginally, three F40/LM chassis were prepared and two were used in races. The first two cars, #79890 and #79891 raced while the third, #88521 was built as a spare which stayed with Michelotto but never officially raced.\r\n\r\nThe first official competition came in 1989 when the F40/LM made its racing debut at the\r\nInternational Motor Sports Association’s (IMSA) Laguna Seca Raceway (now Weather Tech Raceway) GTO/GTU round for modified performance cars and driven by former Ferrari F-1 great Jean Alesi, ultimately finishing third. As Hurley Haywood remembered of the F40/LMs at the time, “It’s either podiums or DNF” as when the cars finished, they were usually on the podium or would fail to finish. In the 1990 IMSA GTO series the F40/LM’s best finishes included three second-places and one third-place accounting for their best results.\r\n\r\nThe F40/LMs did not return to IMSA in 1991 but did make appearances in important European series such as BPR Global GT Series and Japanese Grand Touring Championship (JGTC) with the most significant finish being an overall win in the 1994 4 Hours of Vallelunga BPR event.\r\n\r\nIn 1995, the numbers of active racing F40/LMs increased to four, developed independently by\r\nPilot-Alxis Racing and Strandell, winning at the 4 Hours of Anderstorp and appearances at Le Mans.

Original paint with original interior. \r\n\r\nThe first Porsche Supercar, the ultimate road-going development of the racing inspired 911 and star symbol of 80’s excess.\r\nSpent many years as part of one of the best Supercar collections in Asia. Serviced by Porsche Classic in 2010. Original paint and interior.\r\n \r\nPorsche Motorsport Master Class:\r\nDesigned and built to compete against Ferrari’s 288 GTO in Group B racing, Porsche introduced the 959, their most sophisticated and elaborately designed road going car to date based on the long-serving 911 in 1986. True to form for Porsche, many of the features found on their racing sport prototypes found their way into the 959 which put Porsche firmly in the business of building Supercars.\r\n\r\nThe 959 technology platform was built on the basis of the 911 model line in an exclusive limited series of 345 cars. With the race proven bi-turbo flat six engine featuring water- cooled, 4-valves per cylinder heads, electronically controlled chassis and all-wheel drive system, as well as an aerodynamically optimized body, Porsche pushed the limits of the standard 911 and created one of the most significant cars in history.\r\n\r\nIn 1982, the FIA created Group B as an undercard category to the new Group C prototype class and a viable production-based GT category to replace Group 5, ushering in what many racing historians point to as the most important era in sports car racing history.\r\n\r\nPorsche and Ferrari had begun production of the 959 and 288 GTO respectively in order to meet the FIA’s Group B homologation requirements that 200 road-going cars be produced. And, while many manufactures committed to Group C (including Porsche) by the same token, Group B failed to gain traction with other manufacturers. However, manufactures such as Audi, Peugeot and Ford saw that Group B regulations would apply to their interpretation of the rules for the World Rally Championship (WRC).\r\n\r\nDespite the demise of Group B sports cars, Porsche produced a racing version of the 959, the 961, to race in a few one-off events such Le Mans (Group C) and in the U.S. IMSA (GTP) series. This was initially successful, the highlight coming in 1986 with a seventh place overall, first in the specially created GTX class finish in it’s first appearance at the 24 Hours of Le Mans with French racing heroes René Metge and Claude Ballot-Lena driving the works entered example.\r\n\r\nLater in 1986, in its one and only appearance in the U.S. at the IMSA Daytona 3-Hour Finale event, the 961 finished 24th overall with drivers Günther Steckkönig and Kees Nierop. Matched against Porsche 962s, Jaguar XJR-5s and March-Chevrolets in the GTP category, the 961’s Dunlop tires struggled on Daytona’s 33o banking and experienced several blowouts which limited the car’s competitiveness.\r\n\r\nThe 961 returned to Le Mans in 1987 but caught fire and nearly burned to the ground after a shunt on the Sunday morning with Nierop driving. The amiable Dutch-Canadian driver who had an overall win at the 1983 12 Hours of Sebring to his credit, had to abandon the car on circuit where it was nearly completely destroyed before track marshals could reach the scene and extinguish the blaze; it was just such a pity.\r\n\r\nAfter the Le Mans inferno, Porsche scrapped the 961 project as the Group B category failed to materialize and sanctioning bodies had difficulty deciding if it was a GT or full out prototype. Porsche Motorsport brought the remains back to Stuttgart, rebuilt the car and it appears today in the Porsche museum in original Rothmans livery.\r\n \r\nPorsche Goes Desert Raiding:\r\nStepping completely out of their element, Porsche entered a highly modified and off- road 959 example in the 1986 Paris-Dakar “Desert Raid” event. Paris-Dakar was emerging as a huge international motorsport event and caught the attention of Porsche (among other makes) which wanted to showcase the all-wheel drive 959 in the wide- ranging conditions from work-a-day roads to desert sands to deep jungle. No other event in the world could come close to throwing so many different driving conditions at competitors as the original Paris-Dakar.\r\n\r\nPorsche’s 959 Paris-Dakar venture ended with a one-two victory for René Metge/ Dominique Lemoyne and Jacky Ickx/Claude Brasseur. In fact a third 959 which was only really intended as a support vehicle, finished the event in sixth place. A hugely historic if not improbable result for Porsche which, to that point, had not been known for off-road racing.\r\n \r\nPorsche 959 For The Road:\r\nOn its introduction at the 1985 IAA Frankfurt, the Porsche 959 was designated as the world’s fastest road-going production car. With a top speed of 197MPH the 959 supplanted the Ruf-Porsche BTR as fastest production car with some concurrent variants such as the 959 S achieving as much as 211MPH.\r\n\r\nPorsche pulled out all of the aero and technological tricks to achieve the 959’s top speeds and was considered as the most technically advanced road-going car ever built. The 959 featured items which are common place today but things like race proven electronically controlled fuel injection, automatic electronic/hydraulic ride height adjustment with a mixture of steel unibody, aluminum doors and front bonnet done in kevlar and fiberglass, things which to this point were only seen in action on the world’s top race circuits.\r\n\r\nAdding to this, the car’s all-wheel drive system set the standard for all future Porsche turbo-charged cars starting with the 993. Likewise, the twin-turbo chargers were, again, race proven by Porsche dating to the early 70’s when their turbo-charged flat six engines dominated the world’s most important sports car races with production based 934s, 935s as well as 936, 956 and 962 prototypes.\r\n\r\nAnd, while market segment competitors like Ferrari and Jaguar were relatively new to turbo and electronic control technology, Porsche had amassed huge amounts of experience and success making the technologies not only fast but reliable enough to routinely win 12 and 24-hour races on the world stage.\r\n \r\n959 Technical Features:\r\nThe list of technical features on the 959 is truly amazing especially considering the cars were made in the mid to late 80s.\r\n• The 959’s sophisticated suspension uses eight shock absorbers (two per wheel), all linked hydraulically eliminating the need for anti-roll bars.\r\n• Initially designed for competition use, 959s feature multiple control-arm mount points so ride height could be changed while maintaining proper suspension geometry.\r\n• Not unheard of for cars of the period, 959s are fitted with anti-lock brakes. Porsche claimed at the time braking distances were “shorter than would be possible for a normal automobile”.\r\n• Ride height and damping may be varied electronically with three ground clearance settings. The 959 may also lower itself automatically at high speed.\r\n• 959 wheels are made from magnesium with hollow spokes, center locks and feature electronic tire pressure monitoring, the first available for a road-going car. The wheels may only be mated to Bridgestone RE71 Denloc tires which were one of the first to utilize run-flat technology.\r\n• The front mounted differential has electronically controlled, hydraulically actuated clutches. The driver may monitor lockup percentage displayed on dashboard gauge.\r\n• Utilizing exotic body materials and a slippery aerodynamic shape, the 959 has a drag coefficient of just 0.31 where an ordinary 911 of the era was 0.38.\r\n• The 959 uses a six speed transaxle with first gear being a “creeper”, not intended for pavement. Thus, the shift knob pattern begins “G-1-2-3-4-5″ with “G’ standing for Gelände (off road).\r\n• To comply with FIA Group B rules, the 959’s engine is just 2.8 liters with the sequential turbocharging system increasing power to 444BHP at 6,500RPM whereas a 911 Turbo of the same period produced 282BHP at 5,500RPM. The kick from the maximum boost of 14.5PSI helped define the car’s character.\r\n• Two identical Kühnle, Kopp & Kausch (KKK) turbos mounted near the cylinder banks each have their own intercooler. At low revs, exhaust from both banks is directed to the left turbo as the right unit is bypassed by a one-way valve\r\n• The second turbo comes into play as revs pass 4000RPM. To that point, any unused exhaust pressure is expelled through a small muffler which is controlled electronically. Porsche claimed that each of the 959s engine management computers cost $10,000 in 1987.\r\n \r\nDebut & Public Response:\r\nDespite its price of DM 431,500 ($225,000), Porsche’s order books for 959s quickly filled and the first allotments sold out with Porsche’s most well-heeled clients lining up for their chance to own the first outright Supercar from Stuttgart.\r\n\r\nAfter its production debut at the 1985 Frankfurt IAA, the first 959s began rolling off the assembly line in Karosserie Bar (not the Porsche factory in Zuffenhausen) in 1986.\r\n\r\nWith what started out as Helmuth Bott’s vision of creating a car to compete in Group B in 1981, Porsche’s top customers could experience the company’s racing technology for themselves and park the car in their own garage five years later.',1,'2025-02-15 17:22:00',NULL,'2025-02-25 20:10:47',0,6),(38,'Porsche','959 Komfort','1987','38-Porsche-1987-959-Komfort-',2400000,3000,'The first Porsche Supercar, the ultimate road-going development of the racing inspired 911 and star symbol of 80’s excess.\r\nSpent many years as part of one of the best Supercar collections in Asia.

The lightweight mid-engine chassis and the Audi-supplied V8 certainly helped with the performance, but what really captured imaginations was the dramatic styling, both inside and out. The steampunk aesthetic helped the C8 to become one of the most instantly recognizable supercars in the world as the striking and sensational Spyker, both back then and now, especially in its market segment. A C8 Spyder appeared in Season 4 episode 7 of Top Gear (UK) driven by Jeremy Clarkson and The Stig.\r\n\r\nHistory\r\nEmerging in 2000, Spyker N.V. Automobile Company was headquartered in Zeewolde, Netherlands, by acquiring the rights to business name Spyker which had produced luxury cars and aircraft components in the first half of 20th century, the company inherited not only the logo but also a style that is visible in one of a kind car interiors. Seventy-five years after the original company disappeared, the brand was resurrected by Victor Muller and designer Maarten de Bruijn. Spyker manufactured exclusive sports cars that stand out among others in terms of performance and aesthetics, but they also carry an engineering heritage that not many manufacturers may emulate.By taking part in the first ever Peking to Paris race in 1907 and taking second place in the 15,000KM trans-continental race, the spirit of invincibility is carried further, as the company’s motto “Nulla tenaci invia est via”, which is Latin for “For the tenacious, no road is impassable.”In December of 2014, Spyker confirmed that it had gone bankrupt hoping to restructure its finances and get back on its feet. The bankruptcy declaration was reverted by early 2015 and the company announced it would continue with the production of sports cars. A short time later, in 2021 Spyker went bankrupt once again.In early 2022, according to a press release, a Russian investor group led by Michael Pessis and Boris Rotenberg will revive the Dutch sports car maker with a dotted but none-the-less colorful history.\r\n\r\nCompany Resurrected\r\nFounded by Muller and designer de Bruijn, Spyker Cars began in it’s new iteration and production of exclusive hand-made sports cars such as the C8 Spyder and C8 Laviolette in 1999 and 2000 was under way. The cars featured elegant Art Decoesque touches such as Lamborghini-inspired scissor doors along with signature glass roofs and luxurious turned aluminum dash and hand-stitched leather accented interiors in the tradition of Bugatti, Rolls Royce and Bentley.\r\n\r\nSpyker selected the bulletproof 400 BHP Audi 4.2 liter twin turbo V8 engine as their power plant mated with the Getrag 6-speed manual transmission propelling the cars to a top speed of nearly 190MPH.\r\n\r\nAfter production of the C8 Double 12 S and C8 Spyder T In 2005, the C8 was approved to be sold in the U.S. market. At the same time, company co-founder and chief designer Maarten de Bruijn left the company to start Silvestris Aquamotive which specializes in building aluminum space frame boats.\r\n\r\nReturn to Racing\r\nThe re-launched Spyker brand also made a big splash in racing, namely in the GT categories of sports car racing and Formula One as the cars were gaining a following and interest in the upstart company grew, Spyker knocked the doors down and entered\r\nthe international racing scene at the highest levels.\r\n\r\nIn 2001, the Spyker Squadron team began utilizing the C8 Double-12R as the platform for their entry into sports car racing, namely blue ribband events such as the 24 Hours of Le Mans, 12 Hours of Sebring and selected ALMS, ELMS and FIA GT championship events.\r\n\r\nName drivers for Spyker Squadron included Dutch stars such as Peter Cox, Tom Coronel and Mike Hezemans joined by other internationally known drivers like Jonny Kane, Peter Dumbreck, Alex Caffi and Ralf Kelleners, among others.\r\n\r\nThe Spyker Squadron’s debut at the 2002 12 Hours of Sebring was inauspicious as the silver and orange liveried cars had a tough go of it with one car retiring at Turn One on the first lap and the other crashing out of the event after four hours. Most embarrassingly, the team repeated its first lap retirements at Turn One in 2003, as both cars fell out soon after the greenflag parking nose to tail inside the retaining wall.\r\n\r\nFortunes at the 24 Hours of Le Mans were not much better with the team competing in the world’s most important motor race eight times in the GT2 class with only 5th and 9th placefinishes in 2009 and 2010 respectively to show for their efforts. To be sure, the team’s finishes would seem to be a major accomplishment given the amount of DNFs and non-classifications in the event over the previous six years; no one could begrudge the tenacious Dutch team of theirfinishing results in 2009 and 2010.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Spyker bought the Midland F-1 Racing team, paying $106.6M for the operation and re-branding the squad the Spyker MF1 Team for the last three races of the 2006 F-1 season. The cars appeared in Dutch national sporting colors, orange with silver accents, Ferrari-supplied V8 customer engines and featuring drivers such as Adrian Sutil, Tiago Monteiro, Christian Albers, Markus Winkelhock and Sakon Yamamoto.\r\n\r\nThe Spyker team’s lone points scoring position was an eighth by Sutil at the 2007 Japanese Grand Prix. The rest of the results were either non-points finishes or DNF’s which accounted for most of the team’s reputation as a mid-field contender at best.\r\n\r\nAfter only 17 Grands Prix, it was announced that due to a partnership split within the team from the parent company, the Spyker MF1 Team would be sold to Indian businessman Vijay Mallya and Dutch entrepreneur Michiel Mol who had ties to Spyker, and the team was rebranded as Force India. Mallya ran into some issues legal back home and the team transformed into Racing Point utilizing the famous pink livery and branding of BWT. In 2020, Lawrence Stroll who had a majority share of the Aston Martin company absorbed Racing Point and transformed it into what is now known as the Aston Martin F1 team.\r\n\r\nWhile arriving onto the exotic sports car and racing scene in the early noughties with great fan fare, Spyker was not able to stay afloat against very active and more established brands and market segment competition. The brand seems little more than a novelty these days, still cool looking, fast and nimble to drive, you definitely won’t see another one going the other way up the club driveway.\r\n\r\nThis Spyker Spyder C 1245 – A partial list of notable equipment on the Spyker C8 Spyder includes:\r\n• 19-inch Aeroblade wheels\r\n• Wide Body specification\r\n• Limited-slip differential\r\n• AP Racing brakes\r\n• “Whisper mode” exhaust system\r\n• Removable soft top\r\n• Xenon headlights\r\n• Quilted leather upholstery\r\n• Turned aluminum interior trim\r\n• Gear shifter with exposed linkage\r\n• Air conditioning',0,'2025-02-15 17:48:21',NULL,'2025-02-15 17:48:21',0,18),(42,'Porsche','Carrera GT','2005','42-Porsche-2005-Carrera-GT-',2000000,4000,'Etc.

The Carrera GT was Porsche’s response to market segment competition in the form of Ferrari Enzo, Pagani Zonda, Koenigsegg CCX, McLaren-Mercedes AMG SLR and other Supercars of the time and was a radical departure for the company so associated with normally aspirated and turbo charged six-cylinder engines in their 911 line ups.\r\n\r\nPorsche followed a whole new route with the Carrera GT creating a hybrid development of the 911 GT1 and LMP1 98 cars of the late 90s by introducing a normally aspirated 5.7 liter dual overhead cam V10 610BPH engine which was originally slated to be a Formula One engine in a Footwork chassis integrated with a radically different 107” long wheel base road going\r\ncar.\r\n\r\nVery little is shared from the 911 range with the Carrera GT however as it was a completely clean sheet of paper designed by Porsche Style Department head, Harm Lagaay, the Dutchman who also designed other Porsches of the period including the 924, 968, 993, Boxster, Cayenne and 996. Lagaay retired on completion of the Carrera GT, which by far stands as his most impressive achievement, in 2004.\r\n\r\nCompared to the 911 models, the Carrera GT is a long car with full aerodynamic treatment around an all-carbon fiber monocoque with the subframe produced by Italian company ATR Composites Group. All Carrera GTs feature a traditional six-speed manual transmission with homage to the Porsche 917 polished beach wood shift knob.\r\n\r\nAt speeds over 70MPH, the dramatic rear wing raises to aide stability and reduce lift at the rear.\r\n\r\nA huge radiator, five times larger than a comparable 911 Turbo of the time, aides in keeping the big engine temps in check and suspension is derived directly from racing.\r\n\r\nPorsche limited colors of the Carrera GT to Basalt Black, GT Silver, Seal Grey, Fayence Yellow and Guards Red with custom colors made by the factory tailor made to client’s wishes.\r\n\r\nThe racing prototype nature of the Carrera GT makes it necessary to have an experienced hand at the wheel. The clutch is derived directly from racing and is razor thin mated with the 603BHP engine which may catch an inexperienced driver out causing loss of control and spinouts as it accelerates like a rocket, 0 to 60MPH in 3.5 seconds.\r\n\r\nThe Carrera GT is all business inside the cockpit, not much on the creature comforts with full race inspired leather seats, the instrument cluster is very reminiscent of previous Porsches and aside from air conditioning, there isn’t much in the way of luxury appointments as with most supercars, the emphasis is on performance and safety rather than comfort.\r\n\r\nThe cars are solidly built and full of weight saving carbon fiber touches throughout. The racing inspired touches such as the foot pedal cluster, key on the left of the steering wheel and Beech Wood shift know are derived directly from Porsche’s racing past. The one diversion from this is the removable hard top which creates an instant open top driving experience. The roof panels conveniently stow away, out of sight under the front bonnet.',0,'2025-02-15 17:51:50',NULL,'2025-02-15 17:51:50',0,14),(43,'Lamborghini','Diablo SE30','1995','43-Lamborghini-1995-Diablo-SE30-',6000000,35000,'Third in line in Lamborghini\'s supercar sequence, following the Miura and Countach, the Diablo represented a fresh direction for the brand. Launched in 1990, the Diablo marked the end of the Countach\'s sixteen-year reign and remained in production until 2001, navigating through financial turbulence and ownership changes.\r\n\r\nThe design of the Diablo began in 1985 under Project 132, led by Marcello Gandini, the mastermind behind the Miura and Countach. Initially contracted by Lamborghini financiers Jean Claude and Patrick Mimran, Gandini\'s design underwent significant revisions after Chrysler acquired Lamborghini in 1987. Chrysler\'s design team in Detroit softened Gandini\'s aggressive edges, resulting in a car that retained Lamborghini\'s distinctiveness without being as radical as Gandini had envisioned. The final design, while refined, still featured the signature scissor doors but departed from the Countach’s aesthetics.\r\n\r\nLamborghini, under Chrysler’s guidance, aimed to create a 200 MPH supercar to compete with the Ferrari F40, Jaguar XJ220, and the McLaren F1. The Diablo achieved this with its powerful V12 engine and advanced aerodynamics, ensuring it could hold its own against these formidable competitors.\r\n\r\nIn 1994, to commemorate Lamborghini’s 30th anniversary, the Diablo SE30 was introduced as a limited-production model, emphasizing performance and weight reduction. The SE30\'s power was boosted to 523 BHP with enhancements such as a tuned fuel system, free-flowing exhaust, and magnesium intake manifolds. It featured manual adjustable anti-roll bars instead of the VT model\'s electronic shocks, and weight-saving measures included fixed plexiglass windows with small sliding vents, replacing the standard power glass windows. Luxuries like air conditioning, stereo, and power steering were omitted, while carbon fiber seats with four-point harnesses were added.\r\n\r\nThe SE30 also had minor exterior changes from the standard Diablo, including a revised front section, integrated straked brake cooling ducts, and a larger rear wing. The engine bonnet featured slats, and the single fog and backup lamps were repositioned to the bumper. Special magnesium alloy wheels, SE30 badging, and the iconic metallic purple paint (with customization options) distinguished the SE30. Only 150 units were produced, making it a rare and highly sought-after model.\r\n\r\nThis Lamborghini Diablo SE30 (#2049) is finished in Argento over a Red Alcantara interior. It is a one-of-one specification in that color combination. It underwent a concours-level restoration and is a European specification car.',0,'2025-02-15 17:54:38',NULL,'2025-02-15 17:54:38',0,7),(44,'Ferrari','Enzo','2004','44-Ferrari-2004-Enzo-',4000000,11000,'The Enzo.\r\nThe name alone evokes passions unlike any car in history. The Enzo was perhaps the most anticipated car Ferrari ever produced as it was launched to an eager audience and motoring media at the 2002 Paris Auto Show. The Enzo was designed by Ken Okuyama at Pininfarina and was the fourth in the series of Ferrari supercars produced every ten years following the 288 GTO, F40, F50 and named for the late legendary company founder Enzo Ferrari.\r\n\r\nTrue to Ferrari supercar form, The Enzo featured much of the contemporary Formula One technology of the time including fully carbon fiber chassis, tub and body, electromagnetic shift transmission, carbon fiber reinforced silicon carbide ceramic composite disc brakes and even a few items that were banned in F-1 at the time such as active (movable) aerodynamic aides and traction control.\r\n\r\nThe Enzo’s legend was further burnished as it made its debut at the height of Ferrari’s incredibly successful relationship with German driving legend Michael Schumacher who scored five his seven World Championships (2000, 2001, 2002, 2003 and 2004) for Il Scuderia which was riding high on the huge run they were experiencing at the time.\r\n\r\nFerrari set the Enzo production at 400 cars which were built from 2002 to 2004. The cars were made available only for Ferrari’s most preferred clients around the world. And, even if a long time Ferrari owner was lucky enough to be on the list, they had to be able to demonstrate all of the Ferraris they had owned in the past, like a virtual resume of car ownership, letters of recommendation which may be akin to the process of being accepted into Harvard as one original owner succinctly put it.\r\n\r\nThe Styling.\r\nThe Enzo looked unlike anything before or after. Okuyama’s design transcended the adage of a Formula One car for the road edict. Nose to tail, the Enzo is pure style and function encapsulated into a breakthrough design which could never be duplicated. To this day, the Enzo is still held as the virtual gold standard in modern supercar design\r\n\r\nMore closely resembling a full bodied prototype, the Enzo’s styling starts at the nose with drop down wings jutting down from the nose a-la the Formula One car with air inlets opening to the radiators which sit either side which forms the basis for the slant-nose front boot.\r\n\r\nThe front and side intakes keep air flowing to the massive engine in the rear, while wind-tunnel-tested ground effects do the work of keeping the car glued to the pavement at speed. Notice that there isn’t a big flashy wing on the rear of the car but even without the aide of a big wing, the Enzo handles as if it’s on rails.\r\n\r\nThe Interior.\r\nAs the car was sculpted from yard and yards of carbon fiber, the material was left unmasked throughout the cabin. The carbon-fiber seats could be ordered in a variety of sizes and positions to fit the driver, with F1-style switches and controls on the dashboard. The sparse cabin approach is typical of the Ferrari supercars as stripping away as much weight as possible was Ferrari’s goal in creating a road-going supercar with the same human-machine interface that had been developed for the track.\r\n\r\nThe Power.\r\nFerrari’s new F140 B V12 engine was a first-generation motor which was originally based on the V8 engine in the Maserati Quattroporte, utilizing the same basic design and 104mm (4.1”) bore spacing. The engine design replaced the former architectures seen in Ferrari V12 and V8 engines in other contemporary models. The F430 was the second Ferrari to receive the V8 version of this new powerplant.\r\n\r\nThe engine the Enzo is longitudinally-mounted and the car has a rear mid-engine, rear wheel drive layout with a 43.9/56.1 front/rear weight distribution. The powerplant is Ferrari’s F140B normally aspirated 65° V12 engine with DOHC, 4 valves per cylinder, variable valve timing and Bosch Motronic ME7 fuel injection with a displacement of 5,998.80cc (6.0 L; 366.1 cu in) generating a power output of 660PS (485 kW; 651BHP) at 7,800RPM and 657 N⋅m (485 lb⋅ft) of torque at 5,500RPM.  The redline limit is 8,200 RPM.\r\n\r\nThe Transmission, Suspension & Brakes.\r\nThe Enzo has a semi-automatic transmission (also known as the F1 gearbox) using paddles to control an automated shifting and clutch mechanism, with LED lights on the steering wheel telling the driver when to change gears. The gearbox has a shift time of just 150 milliseconds. The transmission was a first generation “clutchless” first seen in road going Ferraris in the late 1990s.\r\n\r\nThe Enzo has four-wheel independent suspension with push-rod actuated shock absorbers which can be adjusted from the cabin, complemented with anti-roll bars at the front and rear.\r\n\r\nThe Ferrari Enzo used carbon ceramic brake discs, a first for a Ferrari road car.\r\n\r\nThe Enzo uses 19” wheels and has 15” Brembo disc brakes. The wheels are held by a single lug nut and fitted with Ferrari Formula One tire partner Bridgestone Potenza Scuderia RE050A tires. \r\n\r\nThe Stats.\r\n- Engine: rear-mid-mounted 6-liter V12\r\n- Horsepower: 660BHP\r\n- Torque: 484 lb-ft\r\n- Top speed: 217MPH\r\n- 0-62 mph: 3.4 seconds\r\n- Price new: $670,000\r\n\r\nThe Overview.\r\nEven though The Enzo is based on racing technology, Ferrari’s most famous supercar never officially raced in sanctioned championship. The FXX derivative took part in Corse Clienti events but these events are not sanctioned races so no real record of Enzo’s taking part in points paying championship races but with the amount of direct Ferrari Formula One technology on the car, the racing pedigree is certainly there.\r\n\r\nThis Enzo, #28809, comes in traditional Rosso Corso over black interior and is a one owner example. The Enzo is fully serviced, needs nothing and includes factory luggage, cover, books, tools, keys and has 11,000 miles.',0,'2025-02-15 17:57:32',NULL,'2025-02-15 17:57:32',1,8),(45,'Ferrari','LaFerrari','2015','45-Ferrari-2015-LaFerrari-',5000000,72,'Fifth among the Ferrari supercars following its older brothers 288 GTO, F40, F50 and Enzo, the La Ferrari (literally meaning “The Ferrari” or in context, “Definitive Ferrari”) debuted at the 2013 Geneva Auto Show and soon after at Auto Shanghai, slated for a 499 total unit production which ran from 2013 to 2016.\r\n\r\nAs usual with every flagship Ferrari model, all 499 La Ferraris were spoken for before production started with eager buyers from around the world lined up for the new generation Ferrari combined V12 petrol engine and KERS/plug-in hybrid Hypercar even with the cost of over $1,000,000.\r\n\r\nAnd, as usual, with each successive supercar Ferrari produces, is automatically given the title “Best car in the world” by the motoring media against stiff competition from the Porsche 918 Spyder to the McLaren P1. Given La Ferrari’s attributes, it’s hard to argue, the car is an absolute masterpiece of mechanical and carbon fiber engineering with the 6.3 liter V12 aided by HY-KERS producing 950BHP with all the movable aerodynamic aides imaginable and twenty-one onboard computers controlling the car’s various functions all within a very comfortable cabin.\r\n \r\nStyling.\r\nLa Ferrari was done completely in-house at Maranello as long-time design collaborator Pininfarina was not involved in the project this time. What stands out immediately on seeing the La Ferrari is the surfboard-like front wing that is suspended under the nose which aides in front downforce and helps sculpt the air around the car, very much in keeping with Ferrari’s history (dating to the F50) of developing their latest flagship creations to be as close in design to their Formula One cars as possible.\r\n\r\nThe other striking La Ferrari attribute includes the cabin which is a beautifully crafted carbon fiber sculpture tub that encapsulates driver and passenger like a full on prototype racing car. Rather than movable seats, Ferrari opted to keep the seats in place for optimum weight distribution and having the steering wheel and pedal cluster fully adjustable to comfortably accommodate the driver.\r\n\r\nOverall, La Ferrari is a long, elegant and dramatic design with just enough Enzo styling cues to bring it all home. Many point to the extended outboard mirrors as the most striking of La Ferrari’s attributes but these small, light racing themed mirrors have been seen on Formula One and sports cars for so many generations now that they’re hardly surprising to see on a Hypercar of this level.\r\n\r\nThere is not a square centimeter of the car that isn’t thoughtfully sculpted for speed and elegance as Ferrari once again raised the bar on the design which others may only try to duplicate but may never eclipse.\r\n\r\nThe carbon fiber monocoque was designed by Ferrari Formula One technical director Rory Byrne, the respected South African designer and engineer who’s designs have won ninety-nine Grands Prix, seven constructor’s World Championships and seven driver’s World Championships, and represents twenty-seven percent more torsional rigidity and twenty-two percent more stiffness than the Enzo.\r\n \r\nPerformance & Drivetrain.\r\nFerrari claims the La Ferrari’s top speed is 217MPH, similar to the Enzo. But, the difference is how quickly it gets there, accelerating from 0 to 62MPH in 2.4 seconds, 0 to 124MPH in under seven seconds and 0 to 186MPH in fifteen seconds. La Ferrari also lapped the famous Ferrari Fiorano test track in 1:19:70, the fastest time ever set by a road-going Ferrari\r\n\r\nLa Ferrari represents the Ferrari’s first attempt to produce a mild hybrid, while making the most powerful engine/drive train in the company’s vaunted history and reducing fuel consumption by forty percent.\r\n\r\nLa Ferrari’s internal combustion petrol powerplant is mounted longitualinally in the rear with rear wheel drive layout with Ferrari F140 direct injection 65º 6.3 liter V12 generating a maximum power output of 800PS (789BHP; 588kW) at 9,000RPM and 700N⋅m (516 lb⋅ft) of torque at 6,750RPM supplemented by a 163 PS (120 kW; 161HP) KERS unit (called HY-KERS), which provides short bursts of extra power mated through its seven-speed F-1 paddle shift gearbox and double wishbone front suspension and multi-link rear suspension.\r\n \r\nHow La Ferrari HY-KERS system works.\r\nFerrari applied Formula One racing technology to produce a hybrid supercar that uses less fuel, emits fewer grams of Co2 and which, oh by the way, accelerates to 60MPH in less than three seconds.\r\n\r\nLa Ferrari captures excess power under braking or when the engine produces a surplus of power (which is always) to a battery pack and then to two electric motors. One provides boost to the V12 gasoline engine and the other drives accessories. La Ferrari’s HY-KERS (Hybrid Kinetic Energy Recovery System) system runs along with the engine, never on its own, so it is technically considered a mild hybrid as Ferrari has made its distaste for fully electric cars known.\r\n\r\nConsisting of two electric engines capable of delivering together a peak power of 120 KW (about 163 HO). La Ferrari HY-KERS system is able to push the car to record performances and simultaneously reducing emissions by about 40%. The two Magneti Marelli electric motors incorporated in the HY-KERS system are controlled by two associated inverters, which are compact in terms of weight and size.\r\n\r\nThe first electric motor provides drive to the vehicle and recovers kinetic energy during braking, storing the accumulated energy in the lithium batteries and thus activating the power over-boost. The second electric motor, on the other hand, driven by the combustion engine, generates electricity used to keep the charge level of the lithium batteries constant, and also provides energy for standard vehicle systems (lighting, air conditioning, etc.).\r\n\r\nHybrid technology is about capturing and recycling energy that would otherwise be wasted. The Toyota Prius series is the best example in the passenger car realm with active hybrid technology that allows the vehicle run a mile or two on battery before the petrol engine kicks in.\r\n\r\nHowever, in the racing world namely in Formula One and the World Endurance Championship P1 class, KERS adds power on top of what the combustion engine produces, just like a turbocharger boosts acceleration. These two most used methods which includes spinning up a flywheel under braking or transferring the power to ultracapacitors (supercapacitors). Both are good for five to ten seconds of boost, either because that’s all the storage systems hold, or due to sanctioning body rules which limit the car to a fixed amount of boost per lap\r\nIn La Ferrari, the system developed jointly between Magnetti Marelli and Ferrari, the energy is diverted to a pair of battery packs bolted to the carbon fiber frame of the vehicle. One is for the propulsion system while the second provides power to electrically driven accessories that include the radiator fan, windshield wipers, air conditioning or even the audio system.\r\n\r\nUsually there’s a limit to how quickly power may be push into a battery pack. Ferrari says it can charge the battery even under full braking that activates ABS. The engine can also charge the battery directly, just as petrol cars do through their alternators. The electric motor outputs 120KW or 163NHP on top of the engine’s 800MHP. In the La Ferrari, this translates to the top speed of 217MPH.\r\n\r\nEnvironmental gains are modest, the La Ferrari emits 330 grams of Co2 per kilometer in European emissions testing, about 10% less than previous similar type Ferrari V12s. A prototype that can run on battery power reduces La Ferrari’s emissions to 220 grams per kilometer. Ferrari states that the La Ferrari isn’t an active hybrid because that is not part of the car’s mission currently.\r\n \r\nLa Ferrari in the Marketplace. \r\nThose fortunate enough to have plunked down their initial $1,000,000 to be the first owners of La Ferraris have seen their investments pay off handsomely as La Ferraris are now trading for well north of $3,000,000 representing a 300 plus percent increase in value from 2015 to present with no let-up in sight.\r\n\r\nSpecial La Ferraris have sold for as high as $7,000,000 to $10,000,000 for a La Ferrari Aperta at auction, both for charity. So, the sky really is the limit on these phenomenal cars as prized collector’s editions.\r\n\r\nThis La Ferrari, #9600, comes in traditional Ferrari Rosso Corso with Nero black interior and red seat inserts, is fully optioned and comes with books, manuals showing on seventy-two miles on the odometer and must be seen to be appreciated.',0,'2025-02-15 18:01:54',NULL,'2025-02-15 18:01:54',1,16);
